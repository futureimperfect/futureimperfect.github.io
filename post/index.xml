But one of its biggest gaps (in my opinion) is the lack of support for custom apps. Tidbyt apps &lt;em>are&lt;/em> relatively &lt;a href="https://github.com/tidbyt/pixlet/blob/main/docs/tutorial.md">easy to write&lt;/a>, (they&amp;rsquo;re written in &lt;a href="https://github.com/bazelbuild/starlark">Starlark&lt;/a>, a dialect of Python). They also have a directory of &lt;a href="https://tidbyt.dev/docs/publish/community-apps">Community Apps&lt;/a> which anyone can contribute to. However, if you just want to build a silly custom app that you have no intention of sharing, (or you just can&amp;rsquo;t imagine other people getting use out of it), then your options are fairly limited. You &lt;em>can&lt;/em> &lt;a href="https://tidbyt.dev/docs/build/build-for-tidbyt#push-to-a-tidbyt">render a WebP image from a Starlark source file and push it to your device&lt;/a>, but if you want it to continuously update there&amp;rsquo;s not much you can do. This is unfortunate, because I was trying to build a custom countdown clock for my daughter based entirely on an inside joke, (her favorite musician is &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Rattigan">Nick Rattigan&lt;/a>, and one of her friends called him &amp;ldquo;rat man&amp;rdquo; at some point and it stuck). So when we recently got tickets to &lt;a href="https://adjacentfestival.com/">Adjacent Fest in Atlantic City&lt;/a> (where he was playing), I decided to create a modified version of the &lt;a href="https://github.com/tidbyt/community/tree/main/apps/countdownclock">Countdown Clock&lt;/a> app with an image I cobbled together of a rat with a man, counting down to the days left before the concert. I ended up solving this problem by writing a script to generate the WebP image, pushing it to my device, and triggering it to run every 90 seconds by a LaunchD job on one of my Mac mini servers. Since I&amp;rsquo;m also passing the &lt;code>-i&lt;/code> option along with an installation ID to &lt;code>pixlet push&lt;/code>, it also &lt;a href="https://tidbyt.dev/docs/integrate/pushing-apps#apps-and-installations">shows up in the Tidbyt mobile app&lt;/a>, as seen below.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Sonos, Apple TV 4K, and Dolby Atmos</title><link>https://everythingisgray.com/2023/05/16/sonos-apple-tv-4k-and-dolby-atmos/</link><pubDate>Tue, 16 May 2023 22:56:58 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://everythingisgray.com/2023/05/16/sonos-apple-tv-4k-and-dolby-atmos/</guid><description>&lt;p>I (somewhat) recently purchased a Sonos system to use as my TV speakers and for listening to music around the house. Overall, just about everything worked out-of-the-box, but I did have some trouble getting Dolby Atmos working with my Apple TV 4K, specifically. I eventually got it working after fiddling with the settings on my LG TV for a while, but I figured I&amp;rsquo;d write about it here in case it will help others or if I forget. :P&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Automatically Publish Hugo Site to GitHub Pages With GitHub Actions</title><link>https://everythingisgray.com/2021/12/29/automatically-publish-hugo-site-to-github-pages-with-github-actions/</link><pubDate>Wed, 29 Dec 2021 00:47:13 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://everythingisgray.com/2021/12/29/automatically-publish-hugo-site-to-github-pages-with-github-actions/</guid><description>&lt;p>In &lt;a href="https://everythingisgray.com/2020/11/03/migrating-from-octopress-to-hugo/">a previous post&lt;/a> I described my process for migrating an existing Octopress site to Hugo, and at the end I said I wanted to figure out how to automatically publish the site to GitHub Pages with GitHub Actions next. I ended up finding a solution for this a while ago, but I wasn&amp;rsquo;t particularly happy with the way it was set up. Before getting too far, though, it&amp;rsquo;s worth mentioning that I ended up going with a multi-repository approach rather than using the same repo with a separate &lt;code>gh-pages&lt;/code> orphan branch. I didn&amp;rsquo;t necessarily have a good reason for picking one approach over the other, except that this was how I got it working initially and I just stuck with it. :) Anyway, the reason I wasn&amp;rsquo;t happy with how it was setup before (and why I decided to change it recently) is that I had &lt;a href="https://github.com/futureimperfect/everythingisgray-hugo/blob/e43a6b290b978e86ac27dfe223920b0006d2b223/deploy.sh">a separate deploy script&lt;/a> for building the Hugo site and publishing the changes to the target repo, but I wanted to use available actions from the &lt;a href="https://github.com/marketplace?type=actions">GitHub Actions Marketplace&lt;/a> as much as possible, and to have a single YAML file to manage it all. Previously, I was using a GitHub Action called &lt;a href="https://github.com/marketplace/actions/webfactory-ssh-agent">&lt;code>ssh-agent&lt;/code>&lt;/a> to load my SSH private key into the SSH agent on the GitHub Actions runners, which was then used for performing Git operations in the deploy script. It turns out that a simpler solution exists if all you want to do is build a Hugo site and deploy it to a separate GitHub Pages repo using GitHub Actions, though. This involves using the &lt;a href="https://github.com/peaceiris/actions-hugo">&lt;code>peaceiris/actions-hugo&lt;/code>&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://github.com/peaceiris/actions-gh-pages">&lt;code>peaceiris/actions-gh-pages&lt;/code>&lt;/a> actions. Next, I&amp;rsquo;ll share how I set this up.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Migrating From Octopress to Hugo</title><link>https://everythingisgray.com/2020/11/03/migrating-from-octopress-to-hugo/</link><pubDate>Tue, 03 Nov 2020 20:09:25 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://everythingisgray.com/2020/11/03/migrating-from-octopress-to-hugo/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://everythingisgray.com/images/2020-11-03-migrating-from-octopress-to-hugo/everythingisgray-plus-hugo.png" alt="Everything is Gray + Hugo" title="Everything is Gray + Hugo">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I recently migrated this blog from &lt;a href="http://octopress.org/">Octopress&lt;/a> to &lt;a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo&lt;/a>. I did this for a few reasons:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>I know next to nothing about Ruby, so troubleshooting toolchain and dependency issues in order to deploy my static site was a huge pain.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Octopress hasn&amp;rsquo;t been updated in &lt;em>years&lt;/em>. Hugo, on the other hand, is &lt;em>very&lt;/em> actively maintained.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Hugo is written in Go, which I&amp;rsquo;m more familiar with. It&amp;rsquo;s also fast and fairly customizable.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>I initially looked into migrating to &lt;a href="https://blog.getpelican.com/">Pelican&lt;/a>, which is a static site generator written in Python, (which I also love). Pelican has been around for a while and seems to have a great community surrounding it, but ultimately I chose Hugo because I&amp;rsquo;m writing more Go than Python these days, and the handful of times I used Hugo at my last job I was impressed with its speed and ease of use. Another reason I ended up going with Hugo is because I found a migration tool called &lt;a href="https://github.com/codebrane/octohug">Octohug&lt;/a> and was able to stand up a local version of my existing site &lt;em>very&lt;/em> quickly, (albeit with a few issues at first). Next, I&amp;rsquo;ll walk through some of the steps I took to migrate this blog.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Get Mac Serial Number Programmatically With Cgo</title><link>https://everythingisgray.com/2018/12/01/get-mac-serial-number-programmatically-with-cgo/</link><pubDate>Sat, 01 Dec 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://everythingisgray.com/2018/12/01/get-mac-serial-number-programmatically-with-cgo/</guid><description>&lt;p>I recently had the occassion to obtain the serial number from a Mac within a Go program.

AutoPkg is an extremely powerful command-line tool that allows IT administrators to automate OS X software packaging and distribution. AutoPkgr extends this functionality by adding the following key features:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Easy tracking of which specific AutoPkg recipes you care about.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Automatic scheduled checks for new downloads that are available as part of the AutoPkg recipes you subscribe to.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Email notifications when new items are downloaded.&lt;/li>

The solution is rather simple, albeit awkward due to the position of the binary operators.

Shortly after making this decision I was frustrated by not being able to &amp;ldquo;jump&amp;rdquo; between words with the option-arrow shortcut. Fortunately, the solution is rather simple — just modify the option-left/right arrow shortcuts in &lt;strong>Preferences &amp;gt; Profiles &amp;gt; Keys&lt;/strong>. The &amp;ldquo;Action&amp;rdquo; should be &amp;ldquo;Send Escape Sequence&amp;rdquo; + &lt;strong>b&lt;/strong> for jumping backwards and &lt;strong>f&lt;/strong> for jumping forward, (e.g., &lt;code>^[b&lt;/code>, and &lt;code>^[f&lt;/code>).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I know I&amp;rsquo;ve tried iTerm in the past, and I&amp;rsquo;m pretty sure not being able to do this right away kept me from continuing to use the tool. After making this change everything has been swell, though.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Speaking at the 2013 JAMF Nation User Conference</title><link>https://everythingisgray.com/2013/09/10/speaking-at-the-2013-jamf-nation-user-conference/</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 Sep 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://everythingisgray.com/2013/09/10/speaking-at-the-2013-jamf-nation-user-conference/</guid><description>&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m very pleased to announce that &lt;a href="http://www.jamfsoftware.com/events/jamf-nation-user-conference/2013/sessions#james-barclay">I&amp;rsquo;ll be speaking&lt;/a> at the &lt;a href="http://www.jamfsoftware.com/jnuc">2013 JAMF Nation User Conference&lt;/a> in Minneapolis, MN.

&lt;p>The primary reason I decided to move to a statically generated site is because I found myself spending more time worrying about whether my site was running and was secure than I did writing. My site was hacked last year because I was running an outdated version of WordPress, and since moving to a new host, (Amazon EC2), I have frequently had to restart MySQL and Apache just to keep the site up. This could be partially due to the fact that I was running the site on a &lt;a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/concepts_micro_instances.html">micro instance&lt;/a>, but now that my blog is static I don&amp;rsquo;t have to worry about that any longer. Another reason why I chose Octopress for my blogging platform is that I like to tinker, and being able to use tools that I&amp;rsquo;m already familiar with and use every day was a huge plus, (Vim, Git, and Markdown, specifically).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Automatically Post Images to Tumblr with Automator</title><link>https://everythingisgray.com/2010/08/19/how-i-use-automator-to-post-images-to-tumblr/</link><pubDate>Thu, 19 Aug 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://everythingisgray.com/2010/08/19/how-i-use-automator-to-post-images-to-tumblr/</guid><description>&lt;p>For the past few months I have been drawing every day on 2.5 x 3.5 inch pieces of Bristol board as part of my most recent &amp;lsquo;&lt;a href="http://koobtra.com/">kooBtrA&lt;/a>&amp;rsquo; project. kooBtrA = ArtBook in reverse, as I plan to self publish a full-color book containing all the images sometime after one year passes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As you might imagine, finding the time to draw every day can be challenging. Not to mention the fact that I&amp;rsquo;ve also been posting these images to my Tumbleog; which includes scanning, resizing, and logging into Tumblr to post the image along with a description and tag. This became mundane after the first few days of posting, so I decided to set time aside to automate this process, as doing so would surely save me time in the long run.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Restore MySQL Database From ibdata and .frm Files</title><link>https://everythingisgray.com/2010/07/21/restore-mysql-database-from-ibdata-and-frm-files/</link><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jul 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://everythingisgray.com/2010/07/21/restore-mysql-database-from-ibdata-and-frm-files/</guid><description>&lt;p>Last week I was presented with a problem that involved restoring a MySQL database for a client using only the &lt;code>/data&lt;/code> folder from an original MySQL installation.

Over the years I&amp;rsquo;ve configured quite a few things on my Mac, and eventually I became accustomed to said customizations. One of the first things I noticed was that when I would unarchive a zip file, the compressed file would stay put. I remembered that a few years ago I learned of a cool way to configure Mac OS X&amp;rsquo;s built-in Archive Utility, (using a System Preference pane), so I immediately went digging. To do this, simply navigate to &lt;code>/System/Library/CoreServices&lt;/code>. From there right or control click on Archive Utility.app, and select &amp;ldquo;Show Package Contents.&amp;rdquo; A new window will open containing a folder named &lt;code>Contents&lt;/code>, within which you&amp;rsquo;ll find &lt;code>Resources&lt;/code>, and finally &lt;code>Archives.prefPane&lt;/code>. Opening this preference pane will result in System Preferences.app asking if you&amp;rsquo;d like to install for all users or for this user only. Voila! Now you can tell Archive Utility to delete the archive after expanding it.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>10 Inspiring Websites</title><link>https://everythingisgray.com/2010/02/01/10-inspiring-websites/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Feb 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://everythingisgray.com/2010/02/01/10-inspiring-websites/</guid><description>&lt;p>Lately I&amp;rsquo;ve been spending quite a bit of time designing websites, whether it&amp;rsquo;s WordPress theme development or Joomla! template design.

The Cappuccino framework allows you to create desktop class applications for the browser, and gives you the ability to run these applications on the desktop, (similar to &lt;a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/air/">Adobe AIR&lt;/a>). One of the many benefits of being able to create applications that run on the desktop is having the ability to run the application while offline.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>XHTML Is Dead, (but Don't Worry)</title><link>https://everythingisgray.com/2009/07/02/xhtml-is-dead-but-dont-worry/</link><pubDate>Thu, 02 Jul 2009 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://everythingisgray.com/2009/07/02/xhtml-is-dead-but-dont-worry/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;strike>Today&lt;/strike> On July 2, 2009, the W3C announced that the XHTML 2 working group will cease development by the end of 2009. Of course all this means is that more time, effort, and man power will be focused on the HTML 5 specification, which is going to drastically change the web, (just take a look at &lt;a href="http://wave.google.com/">Google Wave&lt;/a>). This also means that we won&amp;rsquo;t have any spec wars to deal with, which are almost as bad as format wars, (HD DVD vs. Blu-Ray anyone?)&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>FlintCast Episode 2 Now on iTunes</title><link>https://everythingisgray.com/2009/07/01/flintcast-episode-2-now-on-itunes/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jul 2009 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://everythingisgray.com/2009/07/01/flintcast-episode-2-now-on-itunes/</guid><description>&lt;p>So I&amp;rsquo;ve managed to get the latest episode of my podcast, &lt;a href="http://flintcast.com/">FlintCast&lt;/a>, on iTunes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I spent a few hours trying to figure out just why it wasn&amp;rsquo;t showing up, turns out I was just impatient, (pinging the servers didn&amp;rsquo;t seem to help, either). Troubleshooting feeds surely can be a headache.&lt;/p>

I recently found &lt;a href="http://www.graphicdesignblog.org/famous-logo-game/">an article on GraphicDesignBlog.org&lt;/a> that makes an interesting game out of it. They display a small fraction of the logo and you are to guess the corporation associated with that identity. I knew all but three right off the bat. Can you guess which one&amp;rsquo;s I missed?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I find that the best and most memorable logos almost always pass this test. Number six is a great example, (only a miniscule portion of the logo is displayed, yet I was able to determine the identity almost immediately).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>American Airlines Site Redesign</title><link>https://everythingisgray.com/2009/06/17/american-airlines-site-redesign/</link><pubDate>Wed, 17 Jun 2009 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://everythingisgray.com/2009/06/17/american-airlines-site-redesign/</guid><description>&lt;p>I heard about a week ago that someone had done a mockup of a possible redesign for the &lt;strong>American Airlines&lt;/strong> website, and the first thing I did was take a look at &lt;a href="http://www.aa.com/aa/homePage.do">their existing site&lt;/a>. It&amp;rsquo;s unbelievable to me that such a huge corporation with so many resources could produce such a terrible, unusable site. I for one haven&amp;rsquo;t ever needed to use the site, but a user interface designer named Dustin Curtis has, (which inspired him to create the mockup.) The redesign is visually interesting as well as functional. You should read more about it/take a look at it &lt;a href="http://dustincurtis.com/dear_american_airlines.html">here&lt;/a>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>NextGEN: Cool WordPress Plugin</title><link>https://everythingisgray.com/2009/06/16/nextgen-cool-wordpress-plugin/</link><pubDate>Tue, 16 Jun 2009 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://everythingisgray.com/2009/06/16/nextgen-cool-wordpress-plugin/</guid><description>&lt;p>After about a month of searching for a WordPress image gallery plugin that is both powerful and easy to use, I came acrossÂ &lt;a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/nextgen-gallery/">NextGEN Gallery&lt;/a>. This plugin is extremely easy to implement, and once activated is easy to maintain/update. I like the fact that you can create multiple galleries and group them together in albums, too. It&amp;rsquo;s also a breeze to update a gallery or album once it&amp;rsquo;s been posted. I&amp;rsquo;m currently using this plugin for my portfolio, (which should include more than a few images soon), and overall I&amp;rsquo;m very pleased.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>FlintCast Is Now Available on iTunes</title><link>https://everythingisgray.com/2009/06/11/flintcast-is-now-available-on-itunes/</link><pubDate>Thu, 11 Jun 2009 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://everythingisgray.com/2009/06/11/flintcast-is-now-available-on-itunes/</guid><description>&lt;p>The folks at iTunes recently accepted my new podcast, which is called &lt;a href="http://flintcast.com/">FlintCast&lt;/a>.

What about the designers and developers that create plugins and themes for these systems?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In order for blogging/content management systems like WordPress to survive, there needs to be a thriving community of developers and users alike. There&amp;rsquo;s certainly no shortage of either in the WordPress community, so I don&amp;rsquo;t see it going anywhere anytime soon. Truthfully, I find that there is a place for both a DIY solution like WordPress and an entirely hosted solution like &lt;a href="http://www.squarespace.com/">Squarespace&lt;/a>. I personally prefer having to dig deep into the CSS, XHTML, and PHP to truly customize a WordPress blog/site, though.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Jobtac Uses "Simplixity" Theme for Their WP Blog</title><link>https://everythingisgray.com/2009/04/30/jobtac-uses-simplixity-theme-for-their-wp-blog/</link><pubDate>Thu, 30 Apr 2009 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://everythingisgray.com/2009/04/30/jobtac-uses-simplixity-theme-for-their-wp-blog/</guid><description>&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s become rather amusing for me to find out just who is using my WordPress theme.

Have we come to a point where the Dreamweaver style IDE, (integrated development environment), has become a thing of the past? Ninety percent of my formal training has been heavily dependent on this model, yet I can&amp;rsquo;t see any forward thinking web designer/developer continuing to rely on it. In many ways, the browser has become my WYSIWYG of choice. You can quickly see the effects of changes made to style sheets and you&amp;rsquo;re not confined to any one proprietary system.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>How To: Installing FreeBSD as a Guest OS in Parallels 4</title><link>https://everythingisgray.com/2009/04/17/how-to-installing-freebsd-as-a-guest-os-in-parallels-4/</link><pubDate>Fri, 17 Apr 2009 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://everythingisgray.com/2009/04/17/how-to-installing-freebsd-as-a-guest-os-in-parallels-4/</guid><description>&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m by no means a UNIX expert, but I&amp;rsquo;ve managed to get the latest stable version of FreeBSD, (7.1), up and running as a guest OS using Parallels Desktop 4.

&lt;p>First, you must download the &lt;a href="http://www.freebsd.org/where.html">latest stable version of FreeBSD&lt;/a>, (at the time this article was written it&amp;rsquo;s 7.1).

The installation process was a breeze, and I was up and running in less than a half hour. The performance is rather snappy considering I&amp;rsquo;m running it in a VM on a 1.83 GHz MacBook Pro with 2GB of RAM, (of which 30GB of disk space and 768MB of RAM is allocated for its use). As for the setup in VMware Fusion, the only unusual step I had to take was to create a custom VM. The operating system that I chose during this process was Windows&amp;gt;Windows Server 2008, (there is currently no Windows 7 template).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>/* Hello World */</title><link>https://everythingisgray.com/2008/10/31/-hello-world-/</link><pubDate>Fri, 31 Oct 2008 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://everythingisgray.com/2008/10/31/-hello-world-/</guid><description>&lt;p>Over the next few months I will be working on developing a WordPress theme.
