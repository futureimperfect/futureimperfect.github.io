&lt;p>As you might imagine, finding the time to draw every day can be challenging. Not to mention the fact that I&amp;rsquo;ve also been posting these images to my Tumbleog; which includes scanning, resizing, and logging into Tumblr to post the image along with a description and tag. This became mundane after the first few days of posting, so I decided to set time aside to automate this process, as doing so would surely save me time in the long run.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>In-store Signing at Pages Bookstore</title><link>https://everythingisgray.com/2010/04/16/in-store-signing-at-pages-bookstore/</link><pubDate>Fri, 16 Apr 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://everythingisgray.com/2010/04/16/in-store-signing-at-pages-bookstore/</guid><description>&lt;p>The kind folks at &lt;a href="http://maps.google.com/maps/place?cid=9976738330174778878&amp;amp;q=pages+bookstore&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;cd=1&amp;amp;ei=TsLIS4qpOof2M7G64IEK&amp;amp;sll=37.0625,-95.677068&amp;amp;sspn=57.379893,85.869141&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;ll=60.630102,-138.691406&amp;amp;spn=0,0&amp;amp;z=4&amp;amp;iwloc=A">Pages Bookstore&lt;/a> have invited me to do a book signing and give a short talk on comics production on May 8, 2010.

I&amp;rsquo;m quite the comics nerd in general, to be honest. It&amp;rsquo;s possible that recently completing the first sequential drawing class offered at my university rekindled this fascination, but who&amp;rsquo;s keeping track? If you&amp;rsquo;re interested in finding out who&amp;rsquo;s responsible for teaching me everything I know about the production of comics, visit my professor&amp;rsquo;s site &lt;a href="http://www.elephanteater.com/">elephanteater.com&lt;/a>. I&amp;rsquo;ll have a few more samples from my comic posted in the portfolio section here shortly. Now back to webcomics, here are a few of my favorites:&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
