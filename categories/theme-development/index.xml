You can view and download it &lt;a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/themes/simplixity">here&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve already begun working on the next update, which should include an easily customizable &lt;code>client.css&lt;/code> file, for making quick changes to the theme.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Do Hosted Solutions Threaten WordPress and Other Blogging Platforms?</title><link>https://everythingisgray.com/2009/05/02/do-hosted-solutions-threaten-wordpress-and-other-blogging-platforms/</link><pubDate>Sat, 02 May 2009 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://everythingisgray.com/2009/05/02/do-hosted-solutions-threaten-wordpress-and-other-blogging-platforms/</guid><description>&lt;p>With completely hosted solutions like &lt;a href="http://www.squarespace.com/">Squarespace&lt;/a> becoming more and more popular everyday, should content creators using WordPress and similar platforms be concerned? What about the designers and developers that create plugins and themes for these systems?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In order for blogging/content management systems like WordPress to survive, there needs to be a thriving community of developers and users alike. There&amp;rsquo;s certainly no shortage of either in the WordPress community, so I don&amp;rsquo;t see it going anywhere anytime soon. Truthfully, I find that there is a place for both a DIY solution like WordPress and an entirely hosted solution like &lt;a href="http://www.squarespace.com/">Squarespace&lt;/a>. I personally prefer having to dig deep into the CSS, XHTML, and PHP to truly customize a WordPress blog/site, though.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Jobtac Uses "Simplixity" Theme for Their WP Blog</title><link>https://everythingisgray.com/2009/04/30/jobtac-uses-simplixity-theme-for-their-wp-blog/</link><pubDate>Thu, 30 Apr 2009 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://everythingisgray.com/2009/04/30/jobtac-uses-simplixity-theme-for-their-wp-blog/</guid><description>&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s become rather amusing for me to find out just who is using my WordPress theme. Sometimes it&amp;rsquo;s not so flattering, other times it is. The other day I discovered that &lt;a href="http://www.jobtac.com/">Jobtac&lt;/a>, a job posting site for employers and job seekers alike, is using &lt;a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/themes/simplixity">Simplixity&lt;/a> for &lt;a href="http://www.jobtac.com/blog/">their blog&lt;/a>. Thanks a lot, guys!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Loopthing Uses "Simplixity" Theme for Their Blog</title><link>https://everythingisgray.com/2009/04/17/loopthing-uses-simplixity-theme-for-their-blog/</link><pubDate>Fri, 17 Apr 2009 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://everythingisgray.com/2009/04/17/loopthing-uses-simplixity-theme-for-their-blog/</guid><description>&lt;p>While browsing through my HTTP referrers I found that an online business network called &lt;em>&lt;a href="http://www.loopthing.com/">Loopthing&lt;/a>&lt;/em> is using my WordPress theme for their blog. So far it looks like the blog is somewhat secondary, (the link to it is on the bottom of the page), but I&amp;rsquo;m honored nonetheless. &lt;a href="http://blog.loopthing.com/">Go take a look.&lt;/a>&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Modification of "Simplixity" WordPress Theme</title><link>https://everythingisgray.com/2009/04/08/modification-of-simplixity-wordpress-theme/</link><pubDate>Wed, 08 Apr 2009 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://everythingisgray.com/2009/04/08/modification-of-simplixity-wordpress-theme/</guid><description>&lt;p>I recently discovered that a gentleman named Pete made a modification of my WordPress theme for his own site. It&amp;rsquo;s exciting to see this being done so early on. It&amp;rsquo;s called &lt;a href="http://www.theteacherlist.ca/">The Teacher List&lt;/a>, go check it out.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Wordpress Theme "Simplixity" Is Now Available on the WordPress Theme Directory</title><link>https://everythingisgray.com/2009/03/31/wordpress-theme-simplixity-is-now-available-on-the-wordpress-theme-directory/</link><pubDate>Tue, 31 Mar 2009 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://everythingisgray.com/2009/03/31/wordpress-theme-simplixity-is-now-available-on-the-wordpress-theme-directory/</guid><description>&lt;p>After correcting a minor mistake that I made to my credit link, the folks at WordPress accepted my new theme and will be featuring it on the WordPress theme directory page.

It&amp;rsquo;s called Simplixity, (which seems appropriate). I am by no means done with this theme, I&amp;rsquo;ve just come to the point where I wanted something to release. I submitted it to the &lt;a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/themes/">WordPress Theme Directory&lt;/a>, but am still waiting for a response as to whether or not they&amp;rsquo;ll feature it. I&amp;rsquo;d like to sincerely thank Small Potato, the author of &lt;a href="http://www.wpdesigner.com/2007/02/19/so-you-want-to-create-wordpress-themes-huh/">a wonderful tutorial&lt;/a> on how to build a WordPress theme, for the invaluable information he has provided. Take a look at the theme, (&lt;strike>which is currently active&lt;/strike>), and let me know what you think.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>/* Hello World */</title><link>https://everythingisgray.com/2008/10/31/-hello-world-/</link><pubDate>Fri, 31 Oct 2008 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://everythingisgray.com/2008/10/31/-hello-world-/</guid><description>&lt;p>Over the next few months I will be working on developing a WordPress theme. I am currently using one of my favorite themes from the WordPress theme directory, which I will be editing in hopes of becoming more familiar with PHP and WordPress in general.
