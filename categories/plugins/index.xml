This plugin is extremely easy to implement, and once activated is easy to maintain/update. I like the fact that you can create multiple galleries and group them together in albums, too. It&amp;rsquo;s also a breeze to update a gallery or album once it&amp;rsquo;s been posted. I&amp;rsquo;m currently using this plugin for my portfolio, (which should include more than a few images soon), and overall I&amp;rsquo;m very pleased.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
