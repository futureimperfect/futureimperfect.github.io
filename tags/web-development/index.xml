&lt;p>The primary reason I decided to move to a statically generated site is because I found myself spending more time worrying about whether my site was running and was secure than I did writing. My site was hacked last year because I was running an outdated version of WordPress, and since moving to a new host, (Amazon EC2), I have frequently had to restart MySQL and Apache just to keep the site up. This could be partially due to the fact that I was running the site on a &lt;a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/concepts_micro_instances.html">micro instance&lt;/a>, but now that my blog is static I don&amp;rsquo;t have to worry about that any longer. Another reason why I chose Octopress for my blogging platform is that I like to tinker, and being able to use tools that I&amp;rsquo;m already familiar with and use every day was a huge plus, (Vim, Git, and Markdown, specifically).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Restore MySQL Database From ibdata and .frm Files</title><link>https://everythingisgray.com/2010/07/21/restore-mysql-database-from-ibdata-and-frm-files/</link><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jul 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://everythingisgray.com/2010/07/21/restore-mysql-database-from-ibdata-and-frm-files/</guid><description>&lt;p>Last week I was presented with a problem that involved restoring a MySQL database for a client using only the &lt;code>/data&lt;/code> folder from an original MySQL installation. The solution turned out to be rather simple, but that didn&amp;rsquo;t stop me from racking my brain for a few hours. Thus, I thought I&amp;rsquo;d share my experience in hopes of helping others that may run into this.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>NOTE&lt;/em> The MySQL database I was tasked with restoring was associated with a WordPress installation. My guess is that this is irrelevant, though.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>10 Inspiring Websites</title><link>https://everythingisgray.com/2010/02/01/10-inspiring-websites/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Feb 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://everythingisgray.com/2010/02/01/10-inspiring-websites/</guid><description>&lt;p>Lately I&amp;rsquo;ve been spending quite a bit of time designing websites, whether it&amp;rsquo;s WordPress theme development or Joomla! template design. A huge part of this process, (for me), is finding inspiration. Below are 10 carefully crafted examples of good web design that I&amp;rsquo;ve been inspired by as of late.&lt;/p>

If you&amp;rsquo;re familiar with Cover Flow/Core Animation on the Mac you&amp;rsquo;ll immediately recognize Snow Stack. In order to run the demo you&amp;rsquo;ll need either the &lt;em>Snow Leopard Beta + Safari&lt;/em> &lt;strong>or&lt;/strong> &lt;em>Leopard + the latest nightly build of WebKit&lt;/em>. Either way, it&amp;rsquo;s quite fascinating to think that this is all being done in the browser.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Cappuccino Web Framework</title><link>https://everythingisgray.com/2009/07/21/cappuccino-web-framework/</link><pubDate>Tue, 21 Jul 2009 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://everythingisgray.com/2009/07/21/cappuccino-web-framework/</guid><description>&lt;p>So lately I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing around with the &lt;a href="http://cappuccino.org/">Cappuccino web framework&lt;/a> and a nifty little programming language called Objective-J. The Cappuccino framework allows you to create desktop class applications for the browser, and gives you the ability to run these applications on the desktop, (similar to &lt;a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/air/">Adobe AIR&lt;/a>). One of the many benefits of being able to create applications that run on the desktop is having the ability to run the application while offline.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>XHTML Is Dead, (but Don't Worry)</title><link>https://everythingisgray.com/2009/07/02/xhtml-is-dead-but-dont-worry/</link><pubDate>Thu, 02 Jul 2009 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://everythingisgray.com/2009/07/02/xhtml-is-dead-but-dont-worry/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;strike>Today&lt;/strike> On July 2, 2009, the W3C announced that the XHTML 2 working group will cease development by the end of 2009. Of course all this means is that more time, effort, and man power will be focused on the HTML 5 specification, which is going to drastically change the web, (just take a look at &lt;a href="http://wave.google.com/">Google Wave&lt;/a>). This also means that we won&amp;rsquo;t have any spec wars to deal with, which are almost as bad as format wars, (HD DVD vs. Blu-Ray anyone?)&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Version 0.5 of Simplixity Is Now Live</title><link>https://everythingisgray.com/2009/05/22/version-0.5-of-simplixity-is-now-live/</link><pubDate>Fri, 22 May 2009 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://everythingisgray.com/2009/05/22/version-0.5-of-simplixity-is-now-live/</guid><description>&lt;p>Today I submitted an update to my WordPress theme Simplixity, which improves how images are handled in posts and fixes an issue that existed while no widgets were activated in the admin panel. You can view and download it &lt;a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/themes/simplixity">here&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve already begun working on the next update, which should include an easily customizable &lt;code>client.css&lt;/code> file, for making quick changes to the theme.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Jobtac Uses "Simplixity" Theme for Their WP Blog</title><link>https://everythingisgray.com/2009/04/30/jobtac-uses-simplixity-theme-for-their-wp-blog/</link><pubDate>Thu, 30 Apr 2009 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://everythingisgray.com/2009/04/30/jobtac-uses-simplixity-theme-for-their-wp-blog/</guid><description>&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s become rather amusing for me to find out just who is using my WordPress theme. Sometimes it&amp;rsquo;s not so flattering, other times it is. The other day I discovered that &lt;a href="http://www.jobtac.com/">Jobtac&lt;/a>, a job posting site for employers and job seekers alike, is using &lt;a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/themes/simplixity">Simplixity&lt;/a> for &lt;a href="http://www.jobtac.com/blog/">their blog&lt;/a>.

Have we come to a point where the Dreamweaver style IDE, (integrated development environment), has become a thing of the past? Ninety percent of my formal training has been heavily dependent on this model, yet I can&amp;rsquo;t see any forward thinking web designer/developer continuing to rely on it. In many ways, the browser has become my WYSIWYG of choice. You can quickly see the effects of changes made to style sheets and you&amp;rsquo;re not confined to any one proprietary system.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
