&lt;p>As you might imagine, finding the time to draw every day can be challenging. Not to mention the fact that I&amp;rsquo;ve also been posting these images to my Tumbleog; which includes scanning, resizing, and logging into Tumblr to post the image along with a description and tag. This became mundane after the first few days of posting, so I decided to set time aside to automate this process, as doing so would surely save me time in the long run.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>MSU Comics Forum</title><link>https://everythingisgray.com/2010/03/20/msu-comics-forum/</link><pubDate>Sat, 20 Mar 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://everythingisgray.com/2010/03/20/msu-comics-forum/</guid><description>&lt;p>Thanks to my mentor and friend &lt;a href="http://www.elephanteater.com/">Ryan Claytor&lt;/a> I&amp;rsquo;ll be tabling at the MSU Comics Forum on March 27, 2010.
