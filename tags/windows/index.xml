The installation process was a breeze, and I was up and running in less than a half hour. The performance is rather snappy considering I&amp;rsquo;m running it in a VM on a 1.83 GHz MacBook Pro with 2GB of RAM, (of which 30GB of disk space and 768MB of RAM is allocated for its use). As for the setup in VMware Fusion, the only unusual step I had to take was to create a custom VM. The operating system that I chose during this process was Windows&amp;gt;Windows Server 2008, (there is currently no Windows 7 template).&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
