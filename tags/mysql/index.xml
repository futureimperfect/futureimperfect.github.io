Thus, I thought I&amp;rsquo;d share my experience in hopes of helping others that may run into this.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>NOTE&lt;/em> The MySQL database I was tasked with restoring was associated with a WordPress installation. My guess is that this is irrelevant, though.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
